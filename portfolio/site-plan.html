        In this website you will find the information on what was learned in the course of WDD 130 Web fundamentals. I divided the content into planning and coding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Planning refers to the activities that are performed before coding such as siteplan, wireframes, among other activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coding refers to the activities from setting up your GitHub upto implementing the guidelines stipulated in the planning section with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).

      <h3>Website Planning</h3>
      <p>
        During WDD 130 – Web Fundamentals there were 3 important concepts for Webpage Planning that are fundamental to webpage planning. These are developing the idea for a website, creating a site plan and a wireframe. These concepts facilitate the web development process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Developing the idea has to be done while thinking about the result. The purpose has to be stated clearly, identifying the audience, and the needs that need to be met. These considerations help to make decisions later in the development process. One exercise that helps with the main idea is the elevator pitch which summarizes all the important information that a person needs to know.
      </p>
      <p>
        Creating a site plan is the guide for the rest of the website. There are important declarations that help the website feel unified across all the web pages. Examples of these are Color decisions, fonts, logos, style, site maps, and wireframes. During this course, we used color pallets from colors.co, check the contrast in websites from webaim.org and the use of Google Fonts among other websites. All these checks help the user experience to be the best as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wireframes specify the elements that will be used in the webpage. It has a sketch view of the website's result. It includes the position for images, paragraphs, navigation bar, and the organization among themselves. This can be done by hand and then moved to the computer. In this course, we used the website wireframe.cc. A well-designed wireframe will allow the developer to quickly accommodate all the elements in the web page as required by the customer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Developing the main idea, elaborating a site plan and creating a wireframe are important in the web site planning process, together they provide clear guidance for the web developer to ensure that the website is created professionally. This although small steps are fundamental to the whole performance of the website.

      <h3>Website Coding</h3>
      <p>
        During WWD 130 – Web Fundamentals, it was covered 3 important topics that are essential for coding. The configuration of websites with GitHub and Visual Studio Code, fundamentals of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), and use of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). With these three elements, a web page can be materialized. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The configuration of GitHub and Visual Studio Code is essential as it is the interface that allows to create the code that will be uploaded to the web. This configuration is very useful in the future as we move forward in the web construction process. All elements can be stored locally in a computer and when changes are made, they can be pushed to the cloud. 
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML is the skeleton of the websites. It contains different tags or selectors that allow the browsers to understand the information being transmitted. It has all the elements that the CSS will use to add the styling. 
      </p>
      <p>
        CSS is the language used for adding styling and manipulating elements present in HTML. A few key lessons are: Selectors and specificity are tied to selectors or IDs used in the HTML code, the box model to change padding, borders, and margins, Grid layout to help elaborate a better display of the elements. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Coding is, in my subjective opinion, the fun part of the process. The beginning of any project is to configure the GitHub site, then if the HTML is not provided, to create it based on the wireframe and the information available for the construction of it then add the styling based on the wireframe, colors chosen, and fonts. Although this might seem as the end of the road, we must always check the code with validation tools like w3.org for CSS and HTML code and webaim.org for color contrast.
