            <p class="planning-parragraph-1">During WDD 130 â€“ Web Fundamentals there were 3 important concepts for Webpage Planning that are
                fundamental to webpage planning. These are developing the idea for a website, creating a site plan and a
                wireframe. These concepts facilitate the web development process.</p>
            <p class="planning-parragraph-2">Developing the idea has to be done while thinking about the result. The purpose has to be stated clearly,
                identifying the audience, and the needs that need to be met. These considerations help to make decisions
                later in the development process. One exercise that helps with the main idea is the elevator pitch which
                summarizes all the important information that a person needs to know.</p>
            <p class="planning-parragraph-3">Creating a site plan is the guide for the rest of the website. There are important declarations that help
                the website feel unified across all the web pages. Examples of these are Color decisions, fonts, logos,
                style, site maps, and wireframes. During this course, we used color pallets from colors.co, check the
                contrast in websites from webaim.org and the use of Google Fonts among other websites. All these checks
                help the user experience to be the best as possible.</p>

            <p class="planning-parragraph-4">Wireframes specify the elements that will be used in the webpage. It has a sketch view of the website's
                result. It includes the position for images, paragraphs, navigation bar, and the organization among
                themselves. This can be done by hand and then moved to the computer. In this course, we used the website
                wireframe.cc. A well-designed wireframe will allow the developer to quickly accommodate all the elements
                in the web page as required by the customer.</p>
            <p class="planning-parragraph-5">Developing the main idea, elaborating a site plan and creating a wireframe are important in the web site
                planning process, together they provide clear guidance for the web developer to ensure that the website
                is created professionally. This although small steps are fundamental to the whole performance of the
                website.</p>
