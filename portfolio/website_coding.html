            <h1>Website Coding</h1>
            <p>During WWD 130 â€“ Web Fundamentals, it was covered 3 important topics that are essential for coding. The configuration of websites with GitHub and Visual Studio Code, fundamentals of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), and use of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). With these three elements, a web page can be materialized.</p>
            <p>The configuration of GitHub and Visual Studio Code is essential as it is the interface that allows to create the code that will be uploaded to the web. This configuration is very useful in the future as we move forward in the web construction process. All elements can be stored locally in a computer and when changes are made, they can be pushed to the cloud.</p>
            <p>HTML is the skeleton of the websites. It contains different tags or selectors that allow the browsers to understand the information being transmitted. It has all the elements that the CSS will use to add the styling.</p>
            <img id="coding-example1" src="images/html_sample.PNG" alt="HTML example">
            <p>CSS is the language used for adding styling and manipulating elements present in HTML. A few key lessons are: Selectors and specificity are tied to selectors or IDs used in the HTML code, the box model to change padding, borders, and margins, Grid layout to help elaborate a better display of the elements.</p>
            <img id="coding-example2" src="images/css_sample.PNG" alt="CSS example">
            <p>Coding is, in my subjective opinion, the fun part of the process. The beginning of any project is to configure the GitHub site, then if the HTML is not provided, to create it based on the wireframe and the information available for the construction of it then add the styling based on the wireframe, colors chosen, and fonts. Although this might seem as the end of the road, we must always check the code with validation tools like w3.org for CSS and HTML code and webaim.org for color contrast.</p>
