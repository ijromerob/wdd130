    <h2>Ivan Romero</h2>
    <h2>- No nickname -</h2>
    <p>My name is Ivan. I live in Calgary Alberta, I'm taking the software development bachelor's degree. This has
         been a dream for me since I was young. I’m very excited and grateful for this 
         program. It has the flexibility that I need to be able to succeed.</p>
    <p>A little bit about my hobbies: I love playing guitar and I’m learning some piano. I also 
        like to play chess. With my wife we love to hike some mountains in the Kananaskis – 
        Banff area.</p>
    <p>I've been married to my wife for over 2 years and is the best decision of my life. I’m 
        grateful for her since she encouraged me to pursue my dreams and go back to 
        school.</p>
    <p>I've been in the church since my parents joined the church when I was 2 years old. I 
        believe the Church is true and I’m grateful for all the opportunities that I have to
        serve. I was a missionary in Bolivia and it was the best experience of my life.</p>
